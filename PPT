1)Prompt Engineering for QA & GitHub Copilot

2)What is Prompt Engineering?
Crafting clear prompts to get quality outputs from AI tools.
Like giving detailed instructions to a junior dev.
Used with ChatGPT, Copilot, Claude, etc.

3)Why Prompt Engineering Matters in QA
Faster test generation (Selenium, API tests)
Edge case discovery & documentation
Code review assistance & bug reproduction

4)How LLMs Work
Token-based prediction engine
Temperature controls randomness
Context window defines memory (e.g., 32K tokens in GPT-4)

5)Anatomy of a Good Prompt
Instruction + Context + Constraints
Use Zero-shot, Few-shot, or Chain-of-thought formats
Be specific about frameworks, inputs, and outputs

6)QA Prompt Templates
UI Test: 'Write Selenide test for login success/failure'
API Test: 'Rest Assured test for POST /users with schema validation'
Edge Cases: 'List 5 test scenarios for form with email and password'

7)Prompting GitHub Copilot
Use comments to guide Copilot suggestions
Break down logic into readable, testable chunks
Add assertions and expected results to improve quality

8)Advanced Prompting Techniques
Prompt Chaining: Break tasks into steps
Role Prompts: 'You are a senior QA engineer...'
Structured Output: 'Respond in JSON with keys: test_name, input...'

9)Debugging and Iterating Prompts
Identify vague vs overloaded prompts
Refine step-by-step and test outputs
Build a PromptPlaybook.md to save working versions

10)Collaborative Prompting
Treat prompts like test cases: review & version them
Create prompt libraries per use case (UI, API, Test Data)
Onboard teammates with shared examples

11)Ethics & Guardrails
Avoid leaking credentials or private APIs
Always review AI-generated code manually
Use only enterprise-grade tools like Copilot Enterprise

12)Future of Prompt Engineering
Agents: Self-prompting workflows
RAG: Use internal docs in generation
CI/CD: Prompt-triggered pipelines for test suggestions
