3. Anatomy of a Good Prompt

The quality of your prompt directly affects the quality of the AI’s response.
Just like a test case needs preconditions, steps, and expected output—your prompt needs structure.

🧱 Components of a Great Prompt

Instruction – What do you want? ("Generate a test")

Context – Framework, language, data, method, etc.

Constraints – Format, length, error handling, what to avoid

Goal – What’s the success condition?

🧪 QA Prompt Example Breakdown

Prompt:

Write a Java test using TestNG and Selenide to test login with valid and invalid inputs. Assert error messages and verify dashboard redirect.

Why it works:
✅ Instruction: "Write a test"✅ Context: Java, TestNG, Selenide, login form✅ Constraints: Include valid and invalid, assertion logic✅ Goal: Test for error + success flows

🧠 Prompt Types with QA Examples

1. Zero-Shot Prompting

Give the instruction without examples
Prompt:

Generate a Selenide test to verify logout redirects to login page.

2. Few-Shot Prompting

Provide 1–2 examples, ask AI to match pattern
Prompt:

Example 1:
@Test public void testLogin() {...}
Example 2:
@Test public void testSignup() {...}
Now generate a test for forgot password.

3. Chain-of-Thought Prompting

Ask the AI to reason step-by-step
Prompt:

List steps to test profile update, then generate Selenide test for it.

Response:

Open profile page

Edit name field

Click save

Assert success message

⚙️ Prompt Optimization Techniques

✏️ Technique 1: Use Action-Oriented Language

Instead of: "Test login"
Write: "Generate a Selenide TestNG test to login with invalid credentials and verify error banner."

🧩 Technique 2: Use Data & URLs

Use this payload: { "name": "test", "email": "test@domain.com" }
Endpoint: POST /api/signup

🧪 Technique 3: Define the Format

Prompt:

Respond only in Java. No explanations. Use Rest Assured with JUnit.

✅ Do's & Don'ts for QA Prompting

✅ Do:

Be specific with inputs, outputs, and tools

Use few-shot examples for format control

Include assert expectations

❌ Don't:

Say "Make a test"

Leave out framework info

Mix multiple requests in one vague sentence

🧠 Practice Prompt Challenge (Try Yourself)

Scenario:
User tries to update their email without verifying password. App should reject update.

Task:
Write a high-quality prompt to get Copilot to generate a Selenide + TestNG test.

(Try writing the prompt and then improve it based on today’s rules!)
